# A3-Preset-Comparer
A lightweight utility designed for Arma 3 that allows users to quickly compare new presets against a master preset, ensuring no required mods are missing.

--- HOW TO USE ---

Load the left side and the right side with a preset (The side that the preset goes to is very important!) and click Compare.

The left side is considered the master preset. Once comparsion is completed addons highlighted in red are missing addons.
The right side is considered the slave preset. Once comparsion is completed addons highlighted in light blue are extra addons.
