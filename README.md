# A3-Preset-Comparer
A lightweight utility designed for Arma 3 that allows users to quickly compare new presets against a reference preset, ensuring no required mods are missing.

--- HOW TO USE ---

Load a preset into both the left (Reference) and right (Target) sides. The side you load each preset into is very important.

Click Compare.

The left side is the Reference preset.

After comparison, addons highlighted in red are missing from the Reference.

The right side is the Target preset.

After comparison, addons highlighted in light blue are extra in the Target.
